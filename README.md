# Hate_speech_multi_label_classification

The primary data for the competition is, in each provided file, the comment_text column. This contains the text of a comment which has been classified as toxic or non-toxic (0...1 in the toxic column). The train setâ€™s comments are entirely in english and come either from Civil Comments or Wikipedia talk page edits. The test data's comment_text columns are composed of multiple non-English languages.

The *-train.csv files and validation.csv file also contain a toxic column that is the target to be trained on.

The jigsaw-toxic-comment-train.csv and jigsaw-unintended-bias-train.csv contain training data (comment_text and toxic) from the two previous Jigsaw competitions, as well as additional columns that you may find useful.

*-seqlen128.csv files contain training, validation, and test data that has been processed for input into BERT.

## What am I predicting?
You are predicting the probability that a comment is toxic. A toxic comment would receive a 1.0. A benign, non-toxic comment would receive a 0.0. In the test set, all comments are classified as either a 1.0 or a 0.0.
